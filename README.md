# Freestyle football to footbag dictionary 

This is a POC of a dictionary of trick names between football and footbag. It's simple shell script. It uses simply 2 files with tricks names. Don't edit those files as line numbers corresponds to the same trick in both sports. In the future I might, or I might not, add more tricks to the file, but for now it is just a POC.

### Usage :

Clone the repo:: 
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lavix5/football-footbag-dictionary.git && cd football-footbag-dictionary
```
Make script executable:

```sh
$ sudo chmod +x ./dictionary.sh
```
Run script with trick name:
```sh
$ ./dictionary.sh trick_name
```
